###Introduction to Markdown
**John Gruber**
>Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
>
Thus, “Markdown” is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML.

**Feature**  

+ Separate content creation from formatting/typesetting
+ Enables writers focus on content creation, no worry about typesetting in content authoring period.
+ Support HTML tags
